## Research interest

I am interested in arithmetic geometry, which studys the connection between algebraic geometry and number theory. I am particularly fascinated by the questions of density of rational points and the questions on unlikely intersections.

## Papers and Preprints



1. Uniform Mordell--Lang plus Bogomolov
2. The uniform Mordell--Lang conjecture
3. Uniformity of quadratic points
